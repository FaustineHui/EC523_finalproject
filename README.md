## Task
In recent years, people have proposed and implemented a large number of methods for artificially synthesizing pictures and media files based on deep learning. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in particular have brought huge quality improvements. Using GANs it is even possible to regenerate images as well as modify existing ones. Based on these functions, some practical software or programs are gradually developed, such as improving the clarity of pictures, or intelligently retouching pictures. However, the technology can also be used for malicious purposes, such as generating fake profiles on social networks or generating fake news. Users are easily confused by GAN-generated images because they may differ from real images by a small amount. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automated tools that can reliably distinguish between authentic and manipulated content. This is also the purpose of our project.
